# COVID REACT APP DESCRIPTION

## General, step by step

the app will open with only the background and the entry place for username. the user will input a username and hit "Go." 

A function will run such that the username will be passed to see if a user exists with that name; if so, it will welcome them in the header and render their results.

This app will take a user date input and either throw an error if invalid or parse and concatinate the input to make a get request to the covid total api with a date query.  

## Prop list

- warnDisplay in Warn/index; set to block in parent when showing warn
- userName in Header/index; pull from db in parent.
